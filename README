NAME
    RT::Extension::ReportSpam - mark tickets as spam with one click

DESCRIPTION
    A simple extension that works with RT 4.0 and 4.2 which allows users to
    report a ticket as a spam message.

INSTALLATION
    "perl Makefile.PL"
    "make"
    "make install"
        May need root permissions

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        If you are using RT 4.2 or greater, add this line:

            Plugin('{{RT::Extension::ReportSpam}}');

        For RT 4.0, add this line:

            Set(@Plugins, qw({{RT::Extension::ReportSpam}}));

        or add "{{RT::Extension::ReportSpam}}" to your existing @Plugins
        line.

        You may also want to set the $SpamAutoDeleteThreshold config option
        to the number of spam reports required before the system will
        automatically delete the ticket. This is useful if none of your
        users have DeleteTicket themselves, but collectively they should be
        able to delete spam tickets for good. Auto-delete is disabled by
        leaving $SpamAutoDeleteThreshold unset or setting it to 0.

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver

USING ON RT 3.8
    Users of this extension on RT 3.8 should not upgrade past version 0.03
    of this extension.

HOW TO …
  Report Spam
    On any ticket page, you can report the ticket as spam by clicking "S".

    You can also click the "S" on the Tools → Spam → Recent page, which
    lists all the recently created tickets with status "new" and without
    owner.

    If you have rights to delete tickets you mark as spam, then they will be
    deleted automatically at the same time.

  Query All Tickets Reported as Spam
    To find all tickets reported as spam and not deleted you can navigate to
    Tools → Spam → Reported, or use the query builder in advanced mode with
    the following query:

        HasAttribute = 'SpamReports'

    Both of these methods list the tickets reported as spam by others
    without rights to delete tickets themselves.

  Confirm a Ticket as Spam
    You can confirm the reports by clicking "S" after querying all tickets
    reported as spam. If you have rights to delete tickets then they will be
    deleted.
